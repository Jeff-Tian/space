<h1>We are seven</h1>
<p align="right">(by William Wordsworth)</p>
<p>A simple child...</p>
<p>That lightly draws its breath</p>
<p>And feels its life in every limb,</p>
<p>What should it know of death?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I met a little cottage girl-</p>
<p>She was eight years old, she said;</p>
<p>Her hair was thick with many a curl</p>
<p>That clustered 'round her head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had a rustic, woodland air</p>
<p>And she was wildly clad;</p>
<p>Her eyes were fair, and very fair;</p>
<p>Her beauty made me glad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sisters and brothers, little maid,</p>
<p>How many may you be?"</p>
<p>"How many? Seven in all," she said</p>
<p>And wondering looked at me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And where are they? I pray you tell."</p>
<p>She answered, "Seven are we;</p>
<p>And two of us at Conway dwell</p>
<p>And two are gone to sea."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Two of us in the churchyard lie,</p>
<p>My sister and my brother</p>
<p>And in the churchyard cottage, I</p>
<p>Dwell near them with my mother."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You say that two at Conway dwell</p>
<p>And two are gone to sea,</p>
<p>Yet, ye are seven! I pray you tell,</p>
<p>Sweet maid, how this may be."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then did the little maid reply,</p>
<p>"Seven boys and girls are we;</p>
<p>Two of us in the churchyard lie,</p>
<p>Beneath the churchyard tree."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You run about, my little maid,</p>
<p>Your limbs they are alive;</p>
<p>If two are in the churchyard laid</p>
<p>Then ye are only five."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Their graves are green, they may be seen,"</p>
<p>The little maid replied,</p>
<p>"Twelve steps or more from my mother's door</p>
<p>And they are side by side."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My stockings there I often knit,</p>
<p>My kerchief there I hem;</p>
<p>And there upon the ground I sit</p>
<p>And sing a song to them."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And often after sunset, sir,</p>
<p>When it is light and fair</p>
<p>I take my little porringer</p>
<p>And eat my supper there."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The first that died was sister Jane;</p>
<p>In bed she moaning lay,</p>
<p>Till God released her of her pain</p>
<p>And then she went away."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So in the churchyard she was laid</p>
<p>And, when the grass was dry</p>
<p>Together round her grave we played,</p>
<p>My brother John and I."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And when the ground was white with snow</p>
<p>And I could run and slide,</p>
<p>My brother John was forced to go</p>
<p>And he lies by her side."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How many are you, then," said I,</p>
<p>"If they two are in heaven?"</p>
<p>Quick was the little maid's reply,</p>
<p>"O master! We are seven."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But they are dead; those two are dead!</p>
<p>Their spirits are in heaven!"</p>
<p>'T was throwing words away; for still</p>
<p>The little maid would have her will</p>
<p>And said... "Nay, we are seven!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>李敖的评语：</p>
<p>虽生有死原非假，</p>
<p>虽死犹生本是真。</p>
<p>生生死死原一体，</p>
<p>不以生死易童心。</p>
