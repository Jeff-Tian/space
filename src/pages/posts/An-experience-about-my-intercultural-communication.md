        <div style="text-indent: 2em; font-size: larger;">
<p>It was in my early college, and it was the first time that I came to Suzhou. I went to lunch with several classmates, and we entered a Lanzhou Ramen Eatery.</p>
<p>The landlady asked us what we want, my classmates took their own order, and then I said to the landlady for my order: "I'll have a bowl of Pork Ramen."</p>
<p>Suddenly the landlady went to very angry, she knocked the desk heavily with her ladle and roared at me. I was shocked then and I didn't know what I should do. My classmates came and tried to help me getting out of that trouble by saying to the landlady: "He want to a bowl of Beef Ramen, he want to a bowl of Beef Ramen."</p>
<p>It was not that I didn't know the truth that the Muslims respect the Pig as god. I just lacked practices of communicate with others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will never forget that thing.</p>
