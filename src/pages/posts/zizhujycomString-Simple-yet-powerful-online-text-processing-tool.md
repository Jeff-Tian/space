<p>During today’s work, I have to distill all the Ids from a large amount of text and organize them in a particular way. These Ids are digital numbers, scattered in these ugly text.</p>  <p>So I made a online tool to do it, and named the tool String.</p>  <p>After the tool is done, I’m quite satisfied by it. Because it can do more than what I had expected. With it you can creat more text processing logic as your need, some javascript programming knowledge is needed though. You can enjoy online programming too.</p>  <p>Visit <a href="http://zizhujy.com/String">http://zizhujy.com/String</a> now to try it out!</p>  <p><a href="http://zizhujy.com/String" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="zizhujy.com/String: Simple yet powerful tool!" border="0" alt="zizhujy.com/String: Simple yet powerful tool!" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeff-Tian/blogengine.net/master/Source/BlogEngine/BlogEngine.NET/App_Data/files/String.png" width="659" height="348" /></a></p>
