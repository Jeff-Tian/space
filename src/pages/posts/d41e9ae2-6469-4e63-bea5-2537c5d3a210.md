<h2><font color="#9b00d3">Problem:</font></h2>  <p>We all know if an input’s value was changed by user input, we can capture this change event by </p>  <pre class="brush: javascript">$('input').change(function(event){
	console.log('user changed the value.');
});</pre>

<p>But if the value was changed by a program, not by user, then the element won’t emit change event. In most cases, this won’t be a problem, because usually we only want to capture user’s behavior and make some responses. However, in some rare cases we still want to capture the programatic changing event. For example, in a multi-level cascading dropdown lists, we need to reload a dropdown’s options once the dependent dropdown’s value was changed, and the dependent dropdown might dependent on another dropdown or input whose value might be changed programatically.</p>

<p>How to capture or hook these changing event by javascript?</p>

<h2><font color="#9b00d3">Solution:</font></h2>

<p>The best way of doing this might be polling the element’s value intervally, and once a change was detected, emit a change event or just trigger the original user change event forcedly.</p>

<h2><font color="#9b00d3">Code snippet:</font></h2>

<pre class="brush: javascript">    function checkChange($element) {
        var originalValue = $element.val();

        setInterval(function () {
                var currentValue = $element.val();
                if(currentValue !== originalValue) {
                    originalValue = currentValue;
                    $element.trigger('change');
                }
            }, 500);
    }&quot;);</pre>

<h2><font color="#9b00d3">Usage example:</font></h2>

<pre class="brush: javascript">    checkChange($('input'));

    $('input').change(function(event){
        console.log('The value was changed.');
    });</pre>
